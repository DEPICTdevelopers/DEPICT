# Path to cytoscape shell launcher (shell script)
# You will find this path in the Cytoscape installation directory.
#cytoscape_executable: <enter path to cytoscape shell launcher>

# OSX EXAMPLE: /Applications/Cytoscape_v3.2.1/cytoscape.sh
# LINUX EXAMPLE: Unknown


# Path to XML file for Cytoscape style. 
cytoscape_style: network_plot_CytoscapeStyle_v1.xml

# The 'Cytoscape style name' can be found in the top part of the XML file: <visualStyle name="DEPICT-style-v1">

[NETWORK STRUCTURE]

# Set the gene set correlation threshold of when to draw edges between two gene sets in the network
# Edges will be drawn betwen gene sets with Pearson correlation *greater or equal* to 'network_correlation_cutoff'
# A low value for 'network_correlation_cutoff' will result in a more dense connected network.
# The options should be a float number.
# Default parameter is 0.3. 
network_correlation_cutoff: 0.3
