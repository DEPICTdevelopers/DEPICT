## Data used in this example

LDL GWAS [summary statistics](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/public/lipids2010/) from [Teslovich Nature 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7307/full/nature09270.html) are used as input in this example. We included all SNPs with P < 5e-8 and manually added chromosome and position columns (hg19/GRCh37).

## Quick start
* Modify depict.py
  * Change the `analysis_path` to the path of the `DEPICT-example` folder
  * Point the `plink_binary` to the PLINK executable on your system
* Run DEPICT
  * `python depict.py`
* Investigate the results which have been written to the following files
  * DEPICT loci `ldl_teslovich_nature2010_loci.txt`
